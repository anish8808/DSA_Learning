vector is a dynamic type od array and defaut size of the vector is zero , vector increased the size 
based on the element means double the size of the array 

Decleration - 

        vector <int> arr;

Initialization -
 
        vector <int> arr{10 , 20 , 30 };
        vector <int> arr(10 , -1); --> Initialization with -1 with the array of size 10

Insert the element in the vector

            arr.push_back(10); --> it will insert the element to the vector
            arr.pop_back(); --> it will delete the element from the vector
            arr.size(); --> it will return the size of the vector
            arr.empty(); --> it will return the arr is empty or not
